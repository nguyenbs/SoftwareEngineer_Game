# Subway Surfer

>Subway Surfers is an endless runner mobile game co-developed by Kiloo[1] and SYBO Games,[2] private companies based in Denmark. It is available on Android, iOS, Kindle, and Windows Phone platforms and uses the Unity game engine.[3] Players take the role of young graffiti artists who, upon being caught in the act of applying graffiti to ("tagging") a metro railway site, run down railroad tracks to escape from an inspector and his dog. As they run, they grab gold coins out of the air while simultaneously dodging collisions with trains and other objects, and can also jump on top of the trains to evade capture. Special events, such as the Weekly Hunt, can result in in-game rewards and characters.

## Gameplay

>Subway Surfers is an endless runner video game. The game starts by tapping the touchscreen, while the character sprays graffiti on a train. The inspector and his dog start chasing. While running, the player can swipe up, down, left, or right to avoid crashing into oncoming obstacles especially moving trains, poles, tunnel walls and barriers. By swapping rapidly as speed increases, more points can be acquired. A crash results in a game over. The player can collect various items such as coins, score multipliers, sprinting sneakers, jetpacks, magnets, gift boxes and scooters. A scooter provides combustion by launching up the player, while a jetpack has ability to fly for 10 seconds. Items, such as a hoverboard, allow avoiding collisions lasting about 30 seconds. Daily Challenges and Weekly Hunts give rewards for unique movements throughout gameplay. Missions have various tasks measured by player accuracy. Up to 14 characters are unlocked via in-game purchase and collecting specific items, but the character "Dino" is only unlocked by connecting a Facebook account.
